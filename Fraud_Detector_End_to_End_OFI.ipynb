    "# Amazon Fraud Detector from End to End for Online Fraud Insights\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Fraud Detector (AFD) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to identify potentially fraudulent online activities such as online payment fraud and the creation of fake accounts. Fraud Detector capitalizes on the latest advances in machine learning (ML) and 20 years of fraud detection expertise from AWS and Amazon.com to automatically identify potentially fraudulent activity so you can catch more fraud faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use the Amazon Fraud Detector API to define an entity and an event of interest and use CSV data stored in S3 to train a model. Next, we'll derive some rules and create a \"detector\" by combining our entity, event, model, and rules into a single endpoint. Finally, we'll apply the detector to a sample of our data to identify potentially fraudulent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this notebook you should be able to:\n",
    "- Define an Entity and an Event\n",
    "- Create a Detector\n",
    "- Train a Machine Learning (ML) Model\n",
    "- Author Rules to identify potential fraud based on the model's score\n",
    "- Apply the Detector's \"predict\" function, to generate a model score and rule outcomes on data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**: The difference between this notebook and the `AFD_End_to_End_Ingested_Data.ipynb` is that, instead of ingesting data to Fraud Detector, it uses an external dataset to build the model. Therefore, this solution does not have \"send events\" section, and uses `EXTERNAL_EVENTS` data scource when create model version. Currently, only Online Fraud Insights template supports building model with external events.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    trainingDataSource  = 'EXTERNAL_EVENTS',\n",
    "    trainingDataSchema  = training_data_schema,\n",
    "    externalEventsDetail = {\n",
    "        'dataLocation'     : S3_FILE_LOC,\n",
    "        'dataAccessRoleArn': ARN_ROLE\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",

    "If you would like to know more, please check out [Fraud Detector's Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "------\n",
    "First setup your AWS credentials so that Amazon Fraud Detector can store and access training data and supporting detector artifacts in S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up AWS Credentials & Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/latest/ug/set-up.html\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Amazon Fraud Detector, you have to set up permissions that allow access to the Amazon Fraud Detector console and API operations. You also have to allow Amazon Fraud Detector to perform tasks on your behalf and to access resources that you own. We recommend creating an AWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) user with access restricted to Amazon Fraud Detector operations and required permissions. You can add other permissions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following policies provide the required permission to use Amazon Fraud Detector. If you are using SageMaker Notebook Instance, add the following two policies to the Instance's IAM role and restart your kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *AmazonFraudDetectorFullAccessPolicy*  \n",
    "    Allows you to perform the following actions:  \n",
    "        - Access all Amazon Fraud Detector resources  \n",
    "        - List and describe all model endpoints in Amazon SageMaker  \n",
    "        - List all IAM roles in the account  \n",
    "        - List all Amazon S3 buckets  \n",
    "        - Allow IAM Pass Role to pass a role to Amazon Fraud Detector  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *AmazonS3FullAccess*  \n",
    "    Allows full access to Amazon S3. This is required to upload training files to S3.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Plan\n",
    "------\n",
    "A *Detector* contains the event, model(s) and rule(s) detection logic for a particular type of fraud that you want to detect. We'll use the following 7 step process to plan a Fraud Detector: \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "1. [Setup notebook](#setup_notebook)<br>\n",
    "    a. Name the major components: entity, entity type, model, detector <br>\n",
    "    b. Plug in your ARN role <br>\n",
    "    c. Plug in your S3 Bucket and CSV File\n",
    "    \n",

    "    a. This will give you an idea of what your dataset contains<br>\n",
    "    b. This will also identify the variables and labels that will need to be created to define your event\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Create event variables and labels](#create_event_variables_and_labels)<br>\n",
    "    a. This will create the variables and labels in fraud detector \n",
    "\n",
    "4. [Define your Entity and Event Type](#define_your_entity_and_event_type)<br>\n",
    "    a. What is activity that you are detecting? That's likely your Event Type (e.g. transaction)<br>\n",
    "    b. Who is performing this activity? That's likely your Entity (e.g. customer)\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. [Create and train your model](#create_and_train_your_model)\t\n",
    "    a. Model training takes anywhere from 45-60 minutes. Once complete you need to promote your endpoint<br>\n",
    "    b. Promote your model\n",
    "\n",
    "6. [Create a Fraud Detector, generate Rules and assemble your Detector](#create_detector)<br>\n",
    "    a. Create your detector<br>\n",
    "    b. Define outcomes, e.g. fraud, investigate and approve<br>\n",
    "    c. Create rules based on your model scores <br>\n",
    "    d. Assemble your detector: combine your rule(s) and model into a \"detector\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7. [Make predictions](#make_predictions)<br>\n",
    "    a. Interactively call predict API on a handful of records   "
