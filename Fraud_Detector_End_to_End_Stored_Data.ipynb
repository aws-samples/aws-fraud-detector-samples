    "## Introduction\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Fraud Detector (AFD) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to identify potentially fraudulent online activities such as online payment fraud and the creation of fake accounts. Fraud Detector capitalizes on the latest advances in machine learning (ML) and 20 years of fraud detection expertise from AWS and Amazon.com to automatically identify potentially fraudulent activity so you can catch more fraud faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use the Amazon Fraud Detector API to define an entity and an event of interest and send events to AFD from a CSV file stored in S3. Next, we'll train a model with Transaction Online Insight template using the events we have sent. After that, we'll derive some rules and create a \"detector\" by combining our entity, event, model, and rules into a single endpoint. Finally, we'll apply the detector to a sample of our data to identify potentially fraudulent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this notebook you should be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Define an Entity and an Event\n",
    "- Send Events to AFD\n",
    "- Train a Machine Learning (ML) Model\n",
    "- Author Rules to identify potential fraud based on the model's score\n",
    "- Create a Fraud Detector\n",
    "- Apply the Detector's \"predict\" function, to generate a model score and rule outcomes on data  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to know more, please check out [Fraud Detector's Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation <a id='Data_preparation'></a>\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you train a Transaction Fraud Insights model, ensure that you have stored at least 10,000 records in your training dataset within Amazon Fraud Detector. We recommend that you collect at least 3-6 weeks of historic data with at least 1,500 unique entities. The Transaction Fraud Insights model compares new entities that are received with the examples of fraudulent and legitimate entities in the training dataset, so it is helpful to provide many examples for each entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the event variables, the training dataset must contain the following headers:\n",
    "* ENTITY_TYPE - Who is performing the activity, e.g. customer. Currently, AFD only support one ENTITY_TYPE per EVENT_TYPE. That column should contain a single value. \n",
    "* ENTITY_ID - Unique ID for who is performing the activity, e.g. customer id\n",
    "* EVENT_ID - Unique ID for each event, e.g. order id\n",
    "* EVENT_TIMESTAMP - Defines when the event occurred\n",
    "* EVENT_LABEL - Classifies the event as fraudulent or legitimate. The values in the column must correspond to the values defined in the event type.\n",
    "* LABEL_TIMESTAMP - Timestamp of when the label is updated. If you do not have that data, you can duplicate the EVENT_TIMESTAMP column and rename it as LABEL_TIMESTAMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/latest/ug/set-up.html\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Amazon Fraud Detector, you have to set up permissions that allow access to the Amazon Fraud Detector console and API operations. You also have to allow Amazon Fraud Detector to perform tasks on your behalf and to access resources that you own. We recommend creating an AWS Identify and Access Management (IAM) user with access restricted to Amazon Fraud Detector operations and required permissions. You can add other permissions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following policies provide the required permission to use Amazon Fraud Detector. If you are using SageMaker Notebook Instance, add the following two policies to the Instance's IAM role and restart your kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *AmazonFraudDetectorFullAccessPolicy*  \n",
    "    Allows you to perform the following actions:  \n",
    "        - Access all Amazon Fraud Detector resources  \n",
    "        - List and describe all model endpoints in Amazon SageMaker  \n",
    "        - List all IAM roles in the account  \n",
    "        - List all Amazon S3 buckets  \n",
    "        - Allow IAM Pass Role to pass a role to Amazon Fraud Detector  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *AmazonS3FullAccess*  \n",
    "    Allows full access to Amazon S3. This is required to upload training files to S3.\n",

    "    \n",
    "## Plan\n",
    "------\n",
    "A *Detector* contains the event, model(s) and rule(s) detection logic for a particular type of fraud that you want to detect. We'll use the following 8 steps to plan a Fraud Detector:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Setup notebook](#setup_notebook)<br>\n",
    "    a. Name the major components: Event, Entity, Model, Detector <br>\n",
    "    b. Specify the MODEL_TYPE you want to train <br>\n",
    "    c. Plug in your S3 Bucket and CSV File\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. [Load and profile your dataset](#load_and_profile_your_data)<br>\n",
    "    a. This will give you an idea of what your dataset contains<br>\n",
    "    b. This will also identify the variables and labels that will need to be created to define your event\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Create event variables and labels](#create_event_variables_and_labels)<br>\n",
    "    a. This will create the variables and labels in fraud detector \n",
    "\n",
    "4. [Define your Entity and Event Type](#define_your_entity_and_event_type)<br>\n",
    "    a. What is activity that you are detecting? That's likely your Event Type (e.g. transaction)<br>\n",
    "    b. Who is performing this activity? That's likely your Entity (e.g. customer)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [Send events](#send_events)<br>\n",
    "    a. This will ingest your events to AFD \n",
    "     \n",
    "6. [Create and train your model](#create_and_train_your_model)\t\n",
    "    a. Model training takes anywhere from 45-60 minutes. Once complete you need to promote your endpoint<br>\n",
    "    b. Promote your model\n",
    "\n",
    "7. [Create a Fraud Detector, generate Rules and assemble your Detector](#create_detector)<br>\n",
    "    a. Create your detector<br>\n",
    "    b. Define outcomes, e.g. fraud, investigate and approve<br>\n",
    "    c. Create rules based on your model scores <br>\n",
    "    d. Assemble your detector: combine your rule(s) and model into a \"detector\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. [Make predictions](#make_predictions)<br>\n",
    "    a. Interactively call predict API on a handful of records   "
